# Usage: conformance-test-harness

The [Conformance Test Harness](https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness) (CTH) is used to run conformance tests against the [Solid specifications](https://solidproject.org/TR/).

# Prerequisites

The tests require 2 user accounts to be set up, referred to as `alice` and `bob`.
These users can be registered on any compatible Solid Identity Provider (IdP) or on the server under test.

The server under test must also host a Pod with a container for running tests. The `alice` user must 
have full control over that container, either because `alice` owns the Pod or because `alice` has been
granted full control access.   

# Configuration
The CTH relies on up to 4 sources of configuration, depending on how the data is likely to be used
and how dynamic it is. They are as follows (in order of least dynamic to most).

## 1. Test Subject Description
This is a Turtle file which describes the test subject and it's capabilities, primarily using
[EARL](http://www.w3.org/ns/earl#) and [DOAP](http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#) vocabularies. It takes the following form:
```
<css>
    a earl:Software, earl:TestSubject ;
    doap:name "Community Solid Server" ;
    doap:release <css#test-subject-release> ;
    doap:developer <https://github.com/solid> ;
    doap:homepage <https://github.com/solid/community-server> ;
    doap:description "An open and modular implementation of the Solid specifications."@en ;
    doap:programming-language "TypeScript" ;
    solid-test:features "authentication", "acl", "wac-allow" .
    
<css#test-subject-release>
    doap:name "CSS 0.9.0" ;
    doap:revision "0.9.0" ;
    doap:created "2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
```
**Note**: The test subject identifier is simply an IRI. It is not meant to be resolvable and can be anything as long as
you specify it on the command line when running tests.

There are some test subject specific configuration properties in this file:
```
  solid-test:features "authentication", "acl", "wac-allow"  # server capabilities
```
An example of this file is provided in the test repository (https://github.com/solid/specification-tests),
containing descriptions of the following Solid implementations:
* `<css>` - [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/community-server) (CSS).
* `<ess>` - [Enterprise Solid Server](https://inrupt.com/products/enterprise-solid-server) (ESS) in Access Control Policies (ACP) compatibility mode.
* `<ess-wac>` - [Enterprise Solid Server](https://inrupt.com/products/enterprise-solid-server) (ESS) in  Web Access Controls (WAC) compatibility mode.
* `<nss>` - [Node Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server) (NSS).
* `<trinpod>` - [TrinPod](https://trinpod.us).

Other implementations will follow as servers are publicly deployed.

You can either use this file and choose which server you are targeting when you run the CTH, or
provide your own version of the file.

## 2. CTH Configuration
This file can be used in place of command line settings if desired but is only required if you want to override default
settings or map URLs or source files to a local file system. It can also control the level of logging but this is better
controlled via environment variables.

The file can have various formats though the example provided is YAML. It  must be in a specific location,
`config/application.yaml`, in your current working directory. The default version of this file, used in the docker image
of the CTH, is maintained at https://github.com/solid/specification-tests/blob/main/application.yaml.
```yaml
# The first 3 can be ignored if using the command line settings: subjects, source and target 
subjects: test-subjects.ttl
sources:
  # Protocol spec & manifest
  - https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol
  - https://github.com/solid/specification-tests/protocol/solid-protocol-test-manifest.ttl

  # WAC spec & manifest
  - https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec
  - https://github.com/solid/specification-tests/web-access-control/web-access-control-test-manifest.ttl

# The target is just an IRI or local name relative to the test-subjects file and is not expected to resolve to anything
target: https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/ess

# To map URLs from the manifest to local files:
mappings:
  - prefix: https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/example
    path: ./example

# Other configuration to override defaults
agent: agent-string		# default = Solid-Conformance-Test-Suite
connectTimeout: 1000	# default = 5000
readTimeout: 1000		# default = 5000
maxThreads: 4           # default = 8, number of threads for running tests in parallel  
origin: https://test    # default = https://tester, origin used for OIDC registration
```

## 3. Environment Variables

The CTH execution can be controlled through the configuration of environment variables that are stored in a `.env` file.

### Server
The CTH needs to know the root URL of the server being tested and the path to the container in which test files
will be created. It can also create a root ACL if the filesystem is initially open:
```
# Server Configuration
RESOURCE_SERVER_ROOT=	# e.g., https://pod.inrupt.com or https://pod-user.inrupt.net
TEST_CONTAINER=         # e.g., pod-user/test or test
SETUPROOTACL=           # boolean this tells the server to setup an ACL on the root
```
These are used to construct the root location for any files created and destroyed by the tests (e.g., `https://pod.inrupt.com/pod-user/test/` or `https://pod-user.inrupt.net/test`).

There are 2 reasons that the test container is defined in this way:
1. Different implementations construct the Pod location from the WebID in different ways, as in the 2 examples above.
2. If tests were run in the Pod owned by the `alice` user, the test container could be created by the CTH but
   this is not possible if you are using a WebID from a different server's IdP. In this case, you need to grant the test 
   user full access to a container in which files can be created. 

### Authentication
There are 4 options for obtaining authentication access tokens when running tests:
1. Client credentials.
2. Refresh tokens.
3. Session-based login.
4. Register users locally (and login during the authorization code request).

**Note**: For each option, a `SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` environment variable needs to be configured that provides the URL of the Solid Identity Provider.

#### 1. Client Credentials
The simplest authentication mechanism is based on the Solid Identity Provider offering the
client credentials authorization flow and requires the users pre-register for these credentials.

This mechanism works well in CI environments where the credentials can be passed in as secrets.

For each user, the following configuration information is required:
* WebID.
* Client Id.
* Client Secret.

The required environment variables are:
```shell
# Authentication Configuration - Client Credentials
SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=	# e.g., https://broker.pod.inrupt.com
USERS_ALICE_WEBID=
USERS_ALICE_CLIENTID=
USERS_ALICE_CLIENTSECRET=
USERS_BOB_WEBID=
USERS_BOB_CLIENTID=
USERS_BOB_CLIENTSECRET=
```

**Note**: The access tokens provided cause a 500 error on NSS so session based login is the only
option for that server.

#### 2. Refresh Tokens
This relies on getting a refresh token from an IdP (e.g., https://broker.pod.inrupt.com/) and
exchanging that for an access token in order to run the tests. 

This process requires a user to go the broker's web page, log in, and authorize the application. Also, the
refresh tokens expire and would need to be recreated regularly which makes it unsuitable for a CI environment.

The refresh token can be created using a
simple bootstrap process:
```shell
npx @inrupt/generate-oidc-token
```

For each user, the following configuration information is required:
* WebID.
* Client Id.
* Client Secret.
* Refresh Token.

The required environment variables are:
```shell
# Authentication Configuration - Refresh Tokens
SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=	# e.g., https://broker.pod.inrupt.com
USERS_ALICE_WEBID=
USERS_ALICE_REFRESHTOKEN=
USERS_ALICE_CLIENTID=
USERS_ALICE_CLIENTSECRET=
USERS_BOB_WEBID=
USERS_BOB_REFRESHTOKEN=
USERS_BOB_CLIENTID=
USERS_BOB_CLIENTSECRET=
```

**Note**: This mechanism will not work for NSS until support for refresh tokens is added:
See https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/issues/1533.

#### 3. Session-based Login 
Some IdPs make it easy to authenticate without a browser by supporting form based login and sessions. The CTH
has the capability to use this mechanism to login and get access tokens but the users must have some additional data 
added to their profiles.  

**Notes**: These updates assume the Profile document contains prefixes:
```
@prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>.
@prefix acl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#>.
```
* Set the Origin as a Trusted App:
    ```
    :me acl:trustedApp [
        acl:mode acl:Read, acl:Write;
        acl:origin <https://tester>  # or whatever origin is defined in the test harness configuration
    ];
    ```
* Solid Identity Provider: (where the URL is the IdP of this account):
    ```
    :me solid:oidcIssuer <https://inrupt.net/>;
    ```
    **Note**: By default, NSS does not add this to new profiles.

For each user, the following configuration information is required:
* WebID.
* Username.
* Password.

A URL for the login form is also required. 

The required environment variables are:
```shell
# Authentication Configuration - Session-based Login
SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=	# e.g., https://inrupt.net
LOGIN_ENDPOINT=		        # e.g., https://inrupt.net/login/password
USERS_ALICE_WEBID=
USERS_ALICE_USERNAME=
USERS_ALICE_PASSWORD=
USERS_BOB_WEBID=
USERS_BOB_USERNAME=
USERS_BOB_PASSWORD=
ORIGIN=                     # optional as it defaults to https://tester
```

This mechanism will work in CI environments where the credentials can be passed in as secrets.

#### 4. Register Users Locally
If an implementation supports user registration, including creating a Pod, then the harness can use this to create the
users before running the tests. This can be very useful in a CI environment where the server is created and destroyed
during the process.

**Note**: There is no standard for this process, so the current implementation only works with CSS. Other
implementations will be added as required.

For each user, the following configuration information is required:
* Username.
* Password.

A URL for the user registration form is also required.

The required environment variables are:
```shell
# Authentication Configuration - Register Users Locally
SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=	# e.g., https://inrupt.net
USER_REGISTRATION_ENDPOINT=	# e.g., https://localhost:3000/idp/register
USERS_ALICE_WEBID=
USERS_ALICE_USERNAME=
USERS_ALICE_PASSWORD=
USERS_BOB_WEBID=
USERS_BOB_USERNAME=
USERS_BOB_PASSWORD=
ORIGIN=                     # optional as it defaults to https://tester
 ```

This mechanism will work in CI environments where the credentials can be passed in as secrets.

## 4. Command Line Options

The command line options are:
```
usage: run
    --coverage        produce a coverage report only
 -f,--filter <arg>    feature filter(s)
    --ignore-failures return success even if there are failures 
 -h,--help            print this message
 -o,--output <arg>    output directory
    --skip-reports    skip report generation
    --skip-teardown   skip teardown (when server itself is being stopped)
 -s,--source <arg>    URL or path to test source(s)
    --status <arg>    status(es) of tests to run
    --subjects <arg>  URL or path to test subject config (Turtle)
 -t,--target <arg>    target server
```
If `--coverage` is not specified then the default action is to run the tests and produce the results reports.

### Logging
By default, the CTH only provides minimal logging. If you want to see the HTTP request/response exchanges in
the logs, you can set `DEBUG` level for the categories shown below:
* `com.intuit.karate` - HTTP interactions within test cases. **Note**: If this is not set to `DEBUG`, the log entries are
  also excluded from the reports.
* `org.solid.testharness.http.Client` - HTTP interactions during container and resource set up.
* `org.solid.testharness.http.AuthManager` - HTTP interactions during the authentication flow before testing starts.

In the environment file, this looks like this:
```
# Logging Levels
quarkus.log.category."com.intuit.karate".level=DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."org.solid.testharness.http.Client".level=DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."org.solid.testharness.http.AuthManager".level=DEBUG
```
**Note**: Tokens in responses or authorization headers as masked as a security measure.

There is a special logging category, called `ResultLogger`, which outputs a summary of the results in JSON format at 
`INFO` level (not necessarily in the order below):
```json
{
  "scenariosPassed":0,
  "scenariosFailed":0,
  "featuresPassed":0,
  "featuresSkipped":0,
  "featuresFailed":0,
  "elapsedTime":1000.0,
  "totalTime":1000.0,
  "resultDate":"2021-06-17 09:12:31 am"
}
```
This results in a log entry such as:
```
2021-06-17 11:43:04,742 INFO  [ResultLogger] (main) {"resultDate":"2021-06-17 11:43:04 am","featuresFailed":0,"elapsedTime":7552.0,"scenariosPassed":4,"featuresSkipped":0,"totalTime":14401.0,"scenariosFailed":0,"featuresPassed":2}
```

### Parallel Testing
By default, the CTH will run tests in parallel, defaulting to 8 threads. You can either override this in the 
YAML config file as mentioned previously, or you can do it with environment variables. For example:
```
# Parallel Testing
MAXTHREADS=2
```

# Execution
The CTH can be executed both locally and within a Docker Container.

## Running in a Docker Container
The simplest way to run the CTH is via the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image published to
https://hub.docker.com/r/solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness.

For ease of use, the Docker image includes the latest release of the tests, manifest files, and test subject
configuration files from https://github.com/solid/specification-tests.

The Docker image works with the following internal structure:
* `/app/harness` - contains the executable jar file.
* `/app/config` - contains the default application.yaml file from https://github.com/solid/specification-tests.
* `/data` - contains the contents of the https://github.com/solid/specification-tests test repository.
* `/reports` - the directory into which reports are written.

To use this image, you just need to provide:

1. An environment file for the server you are testing; and,
1. The test subject using the `target` option on the command line.

When you run the server in a container, there are some important things to remember:
* You cannot use localhost, so you need to name your instance and use that name to access it from the test container.
  The CTH is set up to allow the name `server` so the URL will be https://server.
* When using a domain name, you may hit the problem that DPoP verification requires https unless you are using
  localhost hence using `https` in the above URL.
* As the image uses `https`, you need to provide a SSL certificate to the server which can be generated
  as a self-signed certificate (as seen in the CSS example below).
* The CTH is set up to detect when you are using https://server, and will allow self-signed certificates. If you see an
  issue with DPoP verification rejecting self-signed certificates, the server being tested will need to be set up to
  have the same capability. For a Node based server, this is done by adding `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`
  to the environment before running the server.

Some additional notes on using the Docker image:
* To run a specific version of the Docker image, you need to append a tag to the image name, e.g.
  `solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness:1.0.0` 
* If you do not specify a version then Docker will use the latest image
* If you want to see the reports, the `/reports` directory must be mapped to a local volume. Alternatively you could use 
this image in your own image which could send the reports to an external location such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.
* If you use the `--skip-reports` option you do not need to map the `/reports` directory.
* If you want to run different tests or supply a different config file, you can mount local directories in place of other
internal ones. For example:
    ```
    docker run -i --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)"/tests:/data \
    -v "$(pwd)"/config:/app/config \
    -v "$(pwd)"/reports/local:/reports \
    --env-file=ess.env solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness \ 
    --output=/reports \
    --target=...
    ```
* If you want to run a specific release of the tests then you will need to clone the repository, checkout the specific
  version and then treat them as local tests, as shown above.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/solid/specification-tests /data
    cd /data
    git checkout v1.0.0
    ```  

### Examples

The following examples demonstrate how a script can work with the Docker image and run tests against:
1. A publicly available Solid server.
1. A Solid server running in a Docker container.
1. A publicly available Solid server with user supplied tests and configuration.

#### Example: Using a publicly available Solid Server
Executes tests against a publicly available server, in this case ESS (https://pod.inrupt.com).

1. Create a file for environment variables (e.g., `ess.env`) with the following contents (based on the 
    client_credentials option):
    ```shell
    SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=
    USERS_ALICE_WEBID=
    USERS_ALICE_CLIENTSECRET=
    USERS_BOB_WEBID=
    USERS_BOB_CLIENTSECRET=
    RESOURCE_SERVER_ROOT=https://pod.inrupt.com
    TEST_CONTAINER=/pod-owner/shared-test/
    ```

1. Create a script based on the following:
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash

    # This uses the test harness docker image with the default tests pulled from a repository.
    # Environment variables are defined in an `env` file in the directory from which you run this script.

    mkdir reports/ess
    docker pull solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness
    docker run -i --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)"/reports/ess:/reports \
    --env-file=ess.env solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness \
    --output=/reports --target=https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/ess
    ```

1. Run `./ess.sh`.
1. The reports will be created in the specified directory.

**Note**: To run against the ESS (ACP) version, you would just need to supply a different environment file and set the target as
`ess`.

#### Example: Using a Solid Server in a Docker Container
Some Solid servers (e.g., CSS) can be run in a Docker container. 

1. This example assumes you have an image of CSS available. If it has not been published, you can build your own:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/solid/community-server
    cd community-server
    docker build --rm -f Dockerfile -t css:latest .
    ```
    **Note**: When using a container, you can't use http://localhost:3000 as this will not be accessible to the CTH
    container. Once you switch to a named container, you will also need to switch to `https` and add a self-signed certificate
    due to restrictions with DPoP. Additionally you will need to add `server` as an alias for `localhost` in your `/etc/hosts`
    file.
2. Create a file for environment variables (e.g., `css.env`) with the following contents (based on the local user registration
option):
    ```shell
    SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=        # e.g. https://server/idp
    USER_REGISTRATION_ENDPOINT=     # e.g. https://server/idp/register
    USERS_ALICE_WEBID=              # e.g. https://server/alice/profile/card#me
    USERS_ALICE_USERNAME=
    USERS_ALICE_PASSWORD=
    USERS_BOB_WEBID=                # e.g. https://server/bob/profile/card#me
    USERS_BOB_USERNAME=
    USERS_BOB_PASSWORD=
    RESOURCE_SERVER_ROOT=           # e.g. https://server
    TEST_CONTAINER=                 # e.g. /alice/
    ```
3. Create a script based on the following. Note that you will need to update the context and import list in the CSS
   config section from the latest example at https://github.com/solid/community-server/blob/main/config/default.json.
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash

    # This uses the test harness docker image with the default tests pulled from a repository.
    # Environment variables are defined in the file `env` in the directory from which you run this script.

    mkdir -p reports/css config

    # Create the configuration file needed to run CSS in https mode.
    cat > ./config/css-config.json <<EOF
    {
    "@context": "",
    "import": [],
    "@graph": [
        {
        "comment": [
            "An example of what a config could look like if HTTPS is required.",
            "The http/server-factory import above has been omitted since that feature is set below."
        ]
        },
        {
        "comment": "The key/cert values should be replaces with paths to the correct files. The 'options' block can be removed if not needed.",

            "options_https": true,
            "options_key": "/config/server.key",
            "options_cert": "/config/server.cert"
        },
        "webSocketHandler": {
            "@type": "UnsecureWebSocketsProtocol",
            "source": { "@id": "urn:solid-server:default:ResourceStore" }
        }
        }
    ]
    }
    EOF

    # Create a self-signed certificate
    openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \

    printf '.'
    sleep 1
    done
    echo 'CSS is running'

    # Run the tests in the test harness
    docker pull solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness
    docker run -i --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)"/reports/css:/reports \
    --env-file=css.env --network=testnet solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness \
    --output=/reports --target=https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/css
    docker stop server
    docker rm server
    docker network rm testnet
    ```
4. Run this script.
5. The reports will be created in the specified directory.

#### Example: Using a publicly available Solid Server providing your own tests and configuration
To use the Docker image to run a set of local tests:
1. Create a directory such as `tests`. This directory should contain the tests, manifest files, and a test subject configuration file. For example:
    * `protocol/test.feature`.
    * `solid-protocol-test-manifest.ttl`.
    * `test-subjects.ttl`.
2. Create a directory called `config`.
3. Create the file `config/application.yaml`. For example:
    ```
    subjects: /data/test-subjects.ttl
    sources:
        - https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/example/protocol/solid-protocol-test-manifest.ttl
        - https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol
    target: https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/ess
    mappings:
        - prefix: https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/example/protocol
        path: /data
    ```
    **Notes**:
    * The paths are internal paths within the CTH Docker image so you next need to map them in the command line.
    * You can set the default target here rather than on the command line - this has to be a URI from the `test-subjects.ttl`
    file.
    * The mapping prefix is whatever you have used within the test manifest file.
4. The command line needs to map the local directories into the Docker image to replace the internal directories:
    ```
    docker run -i --rm \
        -v "$(pwd)"/tests:/data 
        -v "$(pwd)"/config:/app/config \
        -v "$(pwd)"/reports/local:/reports \
        --env-file=ess.env solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness \
        --output=/reports --target=https://github.com/solid/conformance-test-harness/ess
    ```
