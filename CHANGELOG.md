## Release 1.0.2

### Minor changes

## Release 1.0.0
This is the first major release of the Conformance Test Harness. Most people will only need to use the containerized
version of this package which comes pre-loaded with a test of tests from the
[Specification Tests Repository](https://github.com/solid/specification-tests). The container image is available on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/solidconformancetestbeta/conformance-test-harness) along with detailed instructions
on how to use it.

### Features
* Various methods of authenticating with test servers.
* Universal access control layer allowing most authorization tests to be run against servers implementing either WAC
  or ACP.
* Test results are reported in Turtle format and in HTML annotated with RDFa to make them human and machine readable. 
  Each test is linked back to the relevant specification requirement and the results include a log of the
  request/response to help tracing any issues.

## Release 0.0.2

### Features
* Improvements to the release process.
* Command line application ready for use - see USAGE.md for details.
